 ###Predict the disease using deep learning.
 
 
This Flask-based web application represents a valuable tool for medical image analysis and diagnosis. It seamlessly combines two critical functions: pneumonia detection and bone fracture identification. With a user-friendly interface, users can easily upload their X-ray images for assessment. The pneumonia detection feature utilizes a deep learning model to swiftly determine whether an individual is affected by pneumonia, aiding in the early identification of respiratory issues. Additionally, the bone fracture detection feature, specialized for specific body parts such as the elbow, hand, and shoulder, offers accurate fracture diagnosis from X-ray images. This application bridges the gap between cutting-edge technology and healthcare, empowering both healthcare professionals and individuals to make informed decisions regarding health and well-being.
